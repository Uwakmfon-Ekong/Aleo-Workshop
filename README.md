# Aleo-Workshop Workshop Documentation: Building and Deploying Aleo Programs

Introduction: This documentation outlines the steps taken during our workshop to build and deploy three different Aleo programs. The programs demonstrate basic arithmetic operations, token minting and transferring, and a simple voice messaging system using Aleo's privacy-preserving smart contracts. Each section will describe the purpose of the program, the code implementation, and the commands used to deploy these programs to the Aleo network.

# Task 1 (Hello world )
## Purpose:
The moovbootcamp_kufre program is a simple smart contract that demonstrates how to perform a basic arithmetic operation (addition) using Aleo.
## Functionality:
This program defines a main function that takes two public u32 integers, a and b, adds them together, and returns the result as c.
## Deployment Command
To deploy the moovbootcamp_kufre program to the Aleo network, use the following command: leo deploy --network testnet
