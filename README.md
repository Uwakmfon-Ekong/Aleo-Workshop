# Aleo-Workshop Workshop Documentation: Building and Deploying Aleo Programs

##Introduction
-** This documentation outlines the steps taken during our workshop to build and deploy three different Aleo programs. The programs demonstrate basic arithmetic operations, token minting and transferring, and a simple voice messaging system using Aleo's privacy-preserving smart contracts. Each section will describe the purpose of the program, the code implementation, and the commands used to deploy these programs to the Aleo network.

## Task 1 (Hello world )
**Purpose
**The moovbootcamp_kufre program is a simple smart contract that demonstrates how to perform a basic arithmetic operation (addition) using Aleo.
